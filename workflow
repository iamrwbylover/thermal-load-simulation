Workflow for Thermal Load Calculator GUI


1. Ask for the values.
2. Save the values using python class  (?)
3. Using the values compute the sunpath.
4. Save computed azimuthal and elevation angle as .xlsx file. 
5. Using saved values from #2 and #4, compute direct and diffused normal irradiance
6. Show a GUI to ask for a plot of the temperature of the walls. Or directly ask for thermal load calculator
